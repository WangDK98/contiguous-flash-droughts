If you find meaningful errors in the code of have questions, please contact dingkui Wang [wangdk23@mail2.sysu.edu.cn]

Steps to run the scripts
download this repository
ownload the required data to the corresponding folder
install the required python modules using conda.  The environment.txt provide information on the required modules.
run and/or edit the scripts in folders.



Instructions:
The code provides a usable procedure for identifying continuous flash events and their various metrics.In addition, the plotting code of some graphs is also provided. 
Because the whole code is broken up, the code may not be directly runnable, and users can change the code according to their needs.
Although a global map of contiguous drought can be obtained, the calculation steps for each metric are not given in detail.
